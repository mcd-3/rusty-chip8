# Rusty CHIP-8

A CHIP-8 Interpreter written in Rust and SDL2.

## Building

To build this project, you will first need SDL2 on your machine.
To get SDL2, [follow the instructions here](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2#requirements).
Make sure to follow the correct instructions for the operating system you are using.

Once SDL2 has been set up on your machine and set up for this project, simply run `cargo run` to build and start the project.
